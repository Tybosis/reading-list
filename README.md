by Tyler Pottle

## Description

This is a single-page reading list creation app, built following the Code School
Soup to Bits episode on [AngularJS](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/soup-to-bits-shaping-up-with-angular-js).

This project also utilized the [Angular Seed Skeleton](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) for the initial layout.
